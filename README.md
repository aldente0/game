# game
This my first project on php.
I wanted to try to make a tic-tac-toe game.
This version without any js.
Over time, I will add js for animation, application operation without reloading the page and adaptability.
My friend php-developer has already called me a pornographer for such an implementation)
At the moment, only the desktop version is ready.
